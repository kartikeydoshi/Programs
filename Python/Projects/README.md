This Project aims to give the user the current weather according to their input of the city.It takes an input of the city and receives a JSON file from the API call made to OpenWeather which it then uses to display information to the user.
It uses the requests module and Tkinter library for Python to achieve HTTP response functionality and for GUI of the app. It has a simple GUI which takes in the city's name and a button to fetch its information. It has error handling the case that the city the user entered does not exist. The user enters the city's name and then clicks on the 'Fetch Weather' button. This leads to an API call to OpenWeather according to the city and a JSON file is received in the app which has weather information about the city. The app then displays the main weather, Tempterature, Feels like and Pressure.
